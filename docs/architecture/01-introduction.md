### Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Lima Planner**. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

***

#### Starter Template or Existing Project

The project will be a **greenfield application**. To accelerate setup and enforce best practices, we will use the official **Nx `next` preset (`@nx/next`)**. This will generate an integrated monorepo with a Next.js application, pre-configured with modern tooling like **Vitest** for testing and ESLint for code quality.
