## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                                     | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation                                                                                                                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEC-001  | Accidental commit of Supabase secrets           | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     | Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`. Use `.env.example` for template. Add pre-commit hook to check for secrets.                               |
| TECH-001 | Incorrect initial setup of Nx/Next.js/Supabase | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Follow official documentation. Create a `README.md` with clear setup instructions. Verify each step in the Acceptance Criteria. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **SEC-001:**
  - Verify that `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`.
  - Attempt to commit a file named `.env.local` and confirm it is ignored.
  - Manually review the initial commit to ensure no secrets were included.

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests

- **TECH-001:**
  - Follow the setup instructions in the `README.md` on a clean machine to validate the process.
  - Run `npx nx serve lima-web` and confirm the application starts without errors.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks affecting security must be mitigated.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Low risks with monitoring in place.
