# Test Design: Story 1.1

Date: 2025-09-18
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Overview

This story is foundational, focusing on project setup. The tests are primarily validation checks of the repository's structure and configuration.

- Total test scenarios: 5
- Unit tests: 1 (20%)
- Integration tests: 1 (20%)
- E2E tests: 1 (20%)
- Manual checks: 2 (40%)
- Priority distribution: P0: 1, P1: 4, P2: 0

## Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: An Nx monorepo is initialized with the package structure (`lima-web`, `ui`, `types`, `domain`) defined in the technical assumptions.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1-MANUAL-001 | Manual | P1 | Verify directory structure | A manual check is sufficient to confirm the folder structure exists as specified. |

### AC2: The `lima-web` Next.js application is created and can be run successfully in a local development environment.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1-E2E-001 | E2E | P1 | Run `npx nx serve lima-web` | This end-to-end check validates that the core application starts correctly. It's not a true E2E user journey but verifies the development environment. |

### AC3: The Supabase client is installed and configured with the necessary environment variables (`.env.example`).

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1-INT-001 | Integration | P0 | Check for Supabase environment variables and client instantiation | This integration test ensures the application can connect to Supabase, mitigating the highest risk (SEC-001). It should not require a live database connection but should verify the client is configured. |

### AC4: Basic linting (ESLint) and code formatting (Prettier) are configured and operational at the root level.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1-UNIT-001 | Unit | P1 | Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` | These are effectively unit tests of the developer tooling configuration. |

### AC5: The initial project structure is committed to a Git repository.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1-MANUAL-002 | Manual | P1 | Inspect git history and `.gitignore` | A manual check to ensure the initial commit is clean and that secrets are not being tracked. |

## Risk Coverage

| Risk ID | Mitigating Test Scenarios |
|---|---|
| SEC-001 | 1.1-INT-001, 1.1-MANUAL-002 |
| TECH-001 | 1.1-MANUAL-001, 1.1-E2E-001, 1.1-UNIT-001 |
