# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **FR1**: Validate the "weekly-first" focus model as a viable product differentiator in the productivity market.
- **FR2**: Launch a functional, offline-capable Progressive Web App (PWA) as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within a 4-month development timeframe.
- **FR3**: Ensure users feel more focused and less overwhelmed by their weekly tasks.
- **FR4**: Enable users to achieve a high completion rate for tasks scheduled within a given week.
- **FR5**: Drive consistent engagement with the "Next Week" planning feature.

## Background Context

Modern professionals are overwhelmed by task management tools that fail to separate immediate priorities from long-term goals, creating a high-noise environment that undermines focus. Existing solutions don't enforce a clear boundary between the "planning space" for future work and the "execution space" for the present.

Lima Planner solves this by being a mobile-first PWA centered on a 7-day "execution view" for the current week. It's differentiated by a dedicated "Next Week" planning area that protects user focus, all built on an offline-first architecture to ensure speed and constant availability.
