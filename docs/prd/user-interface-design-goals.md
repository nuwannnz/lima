# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The application's UX will be centered on creating a "calm productivity" environment. The design must be clean, intuitive, and mobile-first, actively protecting the user's focus on the current week. The core philosophy is "clarity over cleverness," ensuring users can manage their tasks with minimal noise and cognitive load.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Primary View:** A 7-day Kanban-style board.
- **Task Manipulation:** Drag-and-drop for reordering and rescheduling tasks.
- **Quick Actions:** Swipe gestures (e.g., swipe right to complete) and long-press menus for common actions like snoozing or deleting.
- **Contextual Information:** A "peek" panel will allow users to quickly preview linked notes without leaving the main board.

## Core Screens and Views

- Main Weekly Board (the primary 7-day view)
- Next Week Planning View
- Task Creation / Editing View
- Project & Note Management Views
- Start-of-Week Carryover/Snooze Prompt
- Settings Page
- Authentication (Login/Signup) Flow

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application will adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

## Branding

To be defined. The initial design will use a clean, minimalist aesthetic with a focus on typography and clear visual hierarchy.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The application will be a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with a mobile-first approach. It must be fully responsive and functional across modern mobile, tablet, and desktop browsers.
